import createTheme from 'styled-components-theme';
import colors from './color';

// The purpose of this document is to take our colors object from _colors and allow our ThemeProvider in index.js to do what it's meant to do :) provide an easier way to access rgb colors. Styled components is a little weird with rgb and hex colors so this is why we had to boiler plate the heck out of this.

// For the future the steps for boilerplating can be found here: https://github.com/erikras/styled-components-theme
// 1. Define the colors (color)
// 2. Apply the themeprovider in index.js
// 3. Create the exportable theme objects with the style components theme lib (this document)
// 4. Use this object by importing it and using the theme.___ value
// 5. Happiness and simpleness
const theme = createTheme(...Object.keys(colors));
export default theme;
